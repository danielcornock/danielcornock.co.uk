I guess it goes without saying that 2020 has been a strange year. Despite what has been thrown at us, I feel that it also opened up a great opportunity to progress. All of that time spent indoors with not much to do gave me the opportunity to spend more time on personal projects and blogging, as well as opening up more doors in my career  due to remote work becoming more widely available.

A project that I started in 2019, Kanbo was a kanban board application inspired by Trello. I wanted to extend the features of Trello to fit with the way that I liked to plan my projects (and also didn't want to pay for Trello's paid plan... cheapskate).

I learned a lot from this project, with my biggest goals being to have near 100% unit test code coverage, abstract away some common functionality in to libraries, and to create an application that I could use for future projects.

It was a success. You can view the live site [here](https://kanbo-ui.herokuapp.com "kanbo") and the write-up I did for it [here](https://www.danielcornock.co.uk/projects/kanbo "Kanbo writeup"). (January)
