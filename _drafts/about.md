I'm a 24 year old developer from Birmingham, UK with a great passion for building web applications.

I work professionally as a front end web application developer, however I've worked on multiple full-stack projects in my own time. I'm passionate about creating coding solutions with a focus on readbility of code and reduced boilerplate.
