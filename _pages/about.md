I'm a 24 year old developer from Birmingham, UK with a passion for building web applications. I work professionally as a front end developer, using Angular with Ionic on a daily basis.

In my free time, I enjoy creating my own projects - sometimes they serve a purpose, and sometimes they're just for fun. This includes [CLI tools](https://github.com/sprucejs/cli), [frameworks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-form-trooper) and [full stack applications](https://app.scoopfinance.co.uk/).

At the moment, I've been putting my heart and soul in to my latest app, [Scoop](https://app.scoopfinance.co.uk). This is my biggest and most comprehensive project to date, including a full role-based authentication system, PWA support, notifications and much more. I actually _paid_ for hosting this time.

Feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielcornock/) or [download my CV]({{ 'assets/files/cv.pdf' | absolute_url }}), but I promise you'll find everything you need on this site.
