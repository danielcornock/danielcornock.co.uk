I'm a 24 year old developer from Birmingham, UK with a passion for building web applications.

I work professionally as a front end web application developer, however I've worked on multiple full-stack projects in my own time. I'm passionate about creating coding solutions with a focus on easy extension and clear readbility of code.

In my free time, I love creating my own projects for fun, or to solve a problem I have in my day-to-day life, as well as writing about the skills I learn along the way.

Outside of coding, I also enjoy running, creating music, editing videos and playing a bit of animal crossing.
