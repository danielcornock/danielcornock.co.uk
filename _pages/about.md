![Photo of me]({{ site.image_dir | append: 'avatar.jpeg' | absolute_url }})

I'm a 24 year old developer from Birmingham, UK with a passion for building web applications.

I work professionally as a full stack developer, using NodeJS and Angular in my day to day. I'm passionate about creating coding solutions with a focus on easy extension and clear readbility of code.

In my free time, I enjoy creating my own projects - sometimes they serve a purpose, and sometimes they're just for fun. Lately, I've taken more of an interest in developing frameworks and tools that make future development faster and more pleasant. I also write the occasional blog post, especially when I've just learned about a new and exciting thing (to me) and want to share it with the world!

At the moment, I'm working on an open source framework accompanied by a CLI that speeds up creating APIs in NodeJS - you can check it out [here](https://github.com/sprucejs).

Feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielcornock/) or [download my CV]({{ 'assets/files/cv.pdf' | absolute_url }}), but I promise you'll find everything you need on this site.
