I'm a 25 year old developer from Birmingham, UK with a passion for building web applications and frameworks. I work professionally as a senior front end developer, specialising in Angular and unit testing.

In my free time, I enjoy creating my own projects - sometimes they serve a purpose, and sometimes they're just for fun. This includes [CLI tools](https://github.com/sprucejs/cli), [frameworks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-power-forms) and [full stack applications](https://app.scoopfinance.co.uk/).

At the moment, I've been putting my heart and soul in to my latest app, [Scoop](https://app.scoopfinance.co.uk). This is my biggest and most comprehensive project to date, including a full role-based authentication system, PWA support, notifications and much more. I actually _paid_ for hosting this time.

I've also been very busy rebuilding a large AngularJS project, using the newest technologies including Nx for monorepo management.
