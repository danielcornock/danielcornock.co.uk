I'm a 24 year old developer from Birmingham, UK with a passion for building web applications.

I work professionally as a front end web application developer, however I've worked on multiple full-stack projects in my own time. I'm passionate about creating coding solutions with a focus on readbility of code and clean unit tests.

I enjoy creating full stack web applications and writing all about them (when I actually bring myself to write up my ideas!).
