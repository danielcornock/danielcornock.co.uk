    I was very pleased with the experience of working with Daniel, and the final product exceeded my expectations – to my eyes, it’s the best of its kind that I’ve seen. Daniel also managed to get the site finished and live in time for a conference I was attending, as I requested, and he continued to suggest creative changes that improved the site even after this.
